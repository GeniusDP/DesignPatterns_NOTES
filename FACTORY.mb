Factories are made to create new instance of class when you need several constructors,
	or when your constructor has too much optional parameters

- Factory method is a static or non-static method which we use to create new instance

- Factory is a class which contains all factory methods
	(We can make it as inner class of base class, so that we can make default constructor private)
